# C-Sharp_Hotel
A Hotel Application made with C#


Hello, How you doing?

My name is Lucas Henrique, but I think you might already know me from other repositories, if you don't you definitely should check it out!

This ons is a Application made with C# that simulates a Hotel daily activities and other cool things.

in this applicaton you should be able to:

1- Represent the Client, Room Maid, Recepcionist and Manager trough classes.
  - All of them have a Name, Documents and Cellphone
  - Every Room Maid need to know how to clean the room and make the bed
  - Every Recepcionist neeed to know how to pick up the phone and how to speak advanced English( Yes, very especific, i know)
  - Every manager needs to know everything that a Room Maid and a Recepcionist know
  
 2- Represent an Hotel entity.

 4- Create a Outsourced HR service.
  - Hire room maids
  - Hire Recepcionists
  - Promote both of them to Manager
 
 5- Use Custom exceptions for invalid documents
 
 
 # Hot to use it/install it
 
 It is simple, you just take the project from github to you local machine and run it in aything that runs C#
 
 Use the program.cs to make the test, there are already some inside there 
 
 
 Feel free to make any changes ou think would be nice! :D
 
 #Thank you!
